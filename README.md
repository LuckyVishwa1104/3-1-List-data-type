List data type

This is a repository containing information about LIST.  Collections data-types are an integral part of programming.  
List is the simplest form of collection data type which is used to nearly implement all the data structure.  
All the concepts related with list along with different built-in functions are covered.

It consist of description of each topic and several sample program on each topics for practical understanding.
It comprise of Two folders first one is of Operations on list. In that there are several files demonstrating different operations on list.
